## Example
### Running
To run the **DPre** algorithm on the **R+L2** task with a random seed of 1 and log the results to `logs/R+L2-DPre-1`, execute the following command:
```
python3 -m train --log_dir logs/R+L2-DPre-1 --prob_id R+L2 --algo_id DPre --seed 1
```
Note that you can also explicitly specify tasks, algorithms, or hyperparameters using command-line arguments.

### Aggregating Results
When experiments with 1-10 seeds are logged in `logs/R+L2-DPre-1`, ..., `logs/R+L2-DPre-10`, run:
```
python3 -m evaluation --log_dir logs/R+L2-DPre --prob_id R+L2 --algo_id DPre
```
Then the evaluarion results are stored in `logs/R+L2-DPre`.
